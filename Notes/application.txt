Subject: Absence Due to Illness and Request to Continue with the Scholarship Programme

Dear Sir,

I am writing to inform you that I was recently absent from my training sessions due to 
illness. I was unable to attend classes during this period and have attached a medical 
certificate for your reference.

I am now feeling better and would like to continue with the scholarship programme. I am 
fully committed to resuming my training as soon as possible.

Yours faithfully,
